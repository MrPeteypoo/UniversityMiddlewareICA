Games Middleware ICA 2
===============

A 3D platformer developed during one of my first year university modules designed to show understanding of games middleware and the creation of games in Unity.

NOTE: The code here is mostly for demonstration purposes. The project MAY build but it will be missing many third party assets which I don't have a license to redistribute. If you would like to use any code then feel free, everything is licensed with the GNU GPLv3 license.
